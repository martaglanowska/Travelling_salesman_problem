# Traveling Salesman Problem solutions
TSP is one of the most popular and classic optimization problems. The seller wants to visit all cities with the least effort possible and return to the starting point. Additional criteria can also be defined.

In this work several techniques to solve the TSP problem were implemented:
 * Breadth First Search, Depth First Search (*BFS_DFS.ipynb* file)
 * Nearest Neighbor algoritm and its modification (*Greedy_NN.ipynb* file)
 * A* algorithm (*A_star.ipynb* file)
 * Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (*Ant_colony_optimization.ipynb* file)

Additionally, *Comparison.ipynb* file contains time and cost comparison of all the methods.
